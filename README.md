# Automne CMS

Open-Source Content Management System released under the [GNU Public License](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)

## Requirements

 - PHP version 5.2 or greater
 - MySQL version 5.0.x or greater
 - Apache 1.3.x or greater
	
For better performances, install the PHP CLI (Command Line Interface) module. See [http://php.net/manual/features.commandline.ph](http://example.com/)p for more information.

## Install

Download available from [http://www.automne-cms.org/download/](http://example.com/)

 1. Copy and unzip the tar.gz archive
 2. Create a database (via phpMyAdmin for instance)
 3. Launch install.php from a web browser. The install process will check your server configuration (see [http://www.automne-cms.org/requirements/](http://example.com/) for more details), create the database tables, etc.
	If you have any trouble during the install process you can always mail us the diagnostic file generated by Automne at contact[at]automne-cms.org or visit our forum.
 4. If PHP CLI is available, choose the "background script" option during the installation.
 5. Once the installation is over, you are invited to login to your website. The default username is 'root' and the password is 'automne'. Then click on User Profile to change the default password.
 6. In order to keep your webserver secure we recommend you to delete both install.php, automne-xxx.tar.gz and demo-xx.tgz

Be aware that there are no themes yet for Automne. Feel free to use a web framework like Twitter Bootsrap or Zurb Foundation to start developing your templates.
