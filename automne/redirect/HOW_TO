If you want to make an automatic redirection 301 from some non-existant URLs (like, URLs from your old website) to current Automne pages :
- Create a CSV file named redirectRules.csv in this folder
- Set content into this CSV like this :
	oldURI;pageId
	oldURI;pageId
	...

oldURI is the old URI to redirect (local URI format, without HTTP and domain, eg. /my/old/url.php) and pageId is the Id of the new page to redirect to.
The file 404.php will handle the redirection 301 from the old, non-existant URL to the new page URL.
